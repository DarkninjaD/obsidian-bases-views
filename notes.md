# next time I should look into.

I need to make sure what I added meshes with "group by". (it might replace it too)
I could use what was made for the left side of the UI for group by to sort the parents task in the way I want.

The main problem is all tasks get sorted regardless of their parent.
I need to make sure that the sorting is done for each parent separately.
nice to have is the accordion view to be able to collapse all the children of a parent.
